# simulates infection WITHOUT recurrent spillover 
# allows both gamma and beta to mutate            
#
# note: this implementation branches people in "generation order" instead of in "time order"
# (faster to run, and still gives the same result in the limit as outbreak_thresh -> infinity)
# for an implementation done in time order, see the function sim_class
#
# also note that if the infection goes extinct the time of extinction is well-defined, and either implementation computes it correctly.
